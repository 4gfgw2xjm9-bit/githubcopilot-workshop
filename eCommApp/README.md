## 🚀 Workshop Journey

What we achieved together through the GitHub Copilot Labs:

- [**Lab 1-2: Foundations**](file:///Users/aaliyah/githubcopilot-workshop/walkthroughs/lab-1-walkthrough.md): Initial build and exploration of the React + Vite architecture.
- [**Lab 3-4: Resilient Testing**](file:///Users/aaliyah/githubcopilot-workshop/walkthroughs/lab-4-walkthrough.md): Scaled to **91.5% coverage** using self-healing AI agents. 🛡️
- [**Lab 5: Agentic Coding**](file:///Users/aaliyah/githubcopilot-workshop/walkthroughs/lab-5-walkthrough.md): Autonomously implemented the **Contact Us** and **Search** features via Issue assignment. 🤖
- [**Lab 6: External Context**](file:///Users/aaliyah/githubcopilot-workshop/walkthroughs/lab-6-walkthrough.md): Integrated **MCP** to connect the IDE to live GitHub and Microsoft Learn data. 🔌
- [**Lab 7: Custom Guardrails**](file:///Users/aaliyah/githubcopilot-workshop/walkthroughs/lab-7-walkthrough.md): Established project standards via custom instructions and chat modes. ⚖️
